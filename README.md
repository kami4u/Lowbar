# Lowbar
    To run the Program first of all 
        1. Check if node and npm is installed?
        2. If it is installed then do npm install which would install all the dependicies.
        3. Now you can run and test the library.
## Goals

1. Continue practicing test-driven development (TDD).
2. Get an 'inside view' of one of the most heavily used JavaScript libraries
[underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) (11m downloads on NPM last month) and
get used to reading its API documentation.
3. Become accustomed to using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to find and install
JS libraries
4. Learn to effectively pair program and use Git/Github as a collaboration tool.
5. Lay the foundations for understanding the functional style of programming that JS lends itself so well to

## Tasks

The Lowbar Sprint involves reimplementing a JS library as if you were its author. 

## Core

These are the core functions to be implemented,

1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains
11. once
12. memoize
13. shuffle
14. invoke
15. sortBy
16. zip
17. sortedIndex
18. flatten
19. intersection

Referencing the APIs of the following;

1. [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
2. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
3. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)
